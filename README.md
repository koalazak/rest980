# rest980

rest980 create a http server to map all [dorita980](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980) methods in a REST API to control your iRobot Roomba 900 series 980 / i7 / i7+ via HTTP requests. Works also with Roomba Combo RVF-Y1 except for the cartography.

## Install
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/koalazak/rest980.git
$ cd rest980
$ npm install
```

## Fimrware version

[Check your robot firmware version!](http://homesupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/529) and set your firmware version in `firmwareVersion` rest980 configuration!

## Configuration
The service can be configured by editing `config/default.json` or by setting environment variables.

|Config File (`config/default.json`)|Environment|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|port|PORT|*(default:3000)* The HTTP port to listen on.|
|blid|BLID|*(required)* The Roomba blid. *|
|password|PASSWORD|*(required)* The Roomba password. *|
|robotIP|ROBOT_IP|*(optional)* Set if you know your robot IP to skip discovery and speed up startup.|
|firmwareVersion|FIRMWARE_VERSION|*(optional)* Set to 1 or 2 depends of your robot firmware version. Use `2` for any firmware >=2 (yes, use 2 if you have firmware version 3). Default to 1 for firmware 1.6.6|
|enableLocal|ENABLE_LOCAL|*(optional)* Set to 'no' if you want to disable local API. Default 'yes'.|
|enableCloud|ENABLE_CLOUD|*(optional)* Set to 'no' if you want to disable cloud API. Default 'yes'.|
|keepAlive|KEEP_ALIVE|*(optional)* Set to 'no' if you want to connect and disconnect to the robot in each request (slow but leave the connection free for the official mobile app).|
|basicAuthUser|BASIC_AUTH_USER|*(optional)* Set to enable basic auth. Both user and pass must be set.|
|basicAuthPass|BASIC_AUTH_PASS|*(optional)* Set to enable basic auth. Both user and pass must be set.|
|sslKeyFile|SSL_KEY_FILE|*(optional)* Set path to key file to enable HTTPS. Both key and cert must be set. [(how to create self signed cert)](http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html)|
|sslCertFile|SSL_CERT_FILE|*(optional)* Set path to cert file to enable HTTPS. Both key and cert must be set. [(how to create self signed cert)](http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html)|

*See [dorita980](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980) for more information and instructions for obtaining your robot blid and password*



## Start API Server
```
$ cd rest980
$ DEBUG=rest980:* npm start
rest980:server Listening on port 3000
```

omit `DEBUG=rest980:*` if you want. You can just run with `npm start`

## Or use Docker Image

You can use [koalazak/rest980](https://hub.docker.com/r/koalazak/rest980/) docker image to run this server in a docker container. Usefull to run on [Synology](https://www.synology.com/en-global/) for example.

Pull Docker image:
```bash
docker pull koalazak/rest980
```

Run Docker image:
```
docker run -e BLID=myuser -e PASSWORD=mypass -e ROBOT_IP=myrobotIP koalazak/rest980
```

## Dockerfile

Also you can local build and test in Docker from this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/koalazak/rest980/blob/master/Dockerfile)

```
docker build . -t koalazak/rest980 
```

## API documentation

Now you can make request to this server on port 3000.
There are 2 main endpoints: `local` and `cloud`, mapped to [dorita980](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980) local and cloud methods as well.

## Error responses:
HTTP status 500 and response:
```
{"message":"human message","error":{}}
```

## Local

### Actions

All cleaning actions are under `/api/local/action/[action]` endpoint using GET method  without query params:

Available actions:

- start
- stop
- pause
- dock
- resume
- cleanRoom

Example: start to clean

```http
GET http://192.168.1.110:3000/api/local/action/start
```
Success Response:
```
{"ok":null,"id":23}
```

Example: clean a specific room

Some roomba types support "room specificic cleaning" - at the time of writing, at least the s9 and the i7 support this featrue. Assuming you have this model, and have a "Smart Map" for the floor you're trying to clean, you can send room specific cleaning commands. The easiest way to find out the values for this is to start a room specific clean via the app, and then look at the `state` endpoint (documented below) and find the `lastCommand` entry. Using this, you can find the room ids. These seem to be stable over time, unless a re-training or new smart map is saved.

The `pmap_id` and `user_pmapv_id` are also derived from the same `lastCommand` trick. These also seem to be stable - unless a new training run or edit to the smart map happens. It's important to get these correct, else your roomba won't clean.


```sh
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.110:3000/api/local/action/cleanRoom -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"ordered": 0, "pmap_id": "123456", "regions": [{"region_id":"5", "region_name":"Hallway","region_type":"hallway"}], "user_pmapv_id": "987654"}'
```

> Note that this is a `POST` becuase it has a body, unlike the other related `action` methods.
